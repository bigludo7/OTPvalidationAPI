   * @DT-DawidWroblewski mentioned about work that is currently concluded at GSMA Authorization Server Authenticator Capabilities Group, where new specification is in formal GSMA approval process. ETA - April 2024.
   * [Link to Member Gateway](https://membergateway.sharepoint.com/sites/wg-ISAG-ASACG)
   * it was suggested to move this issue to a discussion at [Identity&Consent Management group](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement) level
2. Number Verification API community input to [OIDC profile discussion](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/pull/121)
   * Number Verification API has its own specifics that has to be considered inside Camara OIDC profile, like:
   * * no need to pass any phone number as a *login_hint* inside authorization request
   * * it must follow OIDC flow, where *network authentication* happens at MNO */authorize* endpoint 
   * * ID Token is a result of OIDC flow, although it does not bring any value to developer currenlty (this might change when Camara community desceibes ID Token & access token in a context of ODIC flow)
   * it was suggested to pass our community feedback **when first document, that decsribes Camara OIDC profile, arrives**
